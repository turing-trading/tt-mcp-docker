# 🐋 Docker MCP server

An MCP server for managing Docker with natural language!

## 🪩 What can it do?

- 🚀 Compose containers with natural language
- 🔍 Introspect & debug running containers
- 📀 Manage persistent data with Docker volumes
- 🔑 Securely configure containers with sensitive data

## ❓ Who is this for?

- Server administrators: connect to remote Docker engines for e.g. managing a
  public-facing website.
- Tinkerers: spin up containers locally, without running a single command
  yourself.

## 🏎️ Quickstart

### Install

#### Claude Desktop

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

<details>
  <summary>Install with `uv`</summary>

To install the MCP server using `uv`, run the following command:

```bash
uv pip install git+https://github.com/ckreiling/mcp-server-docker
```

And then add the following to your MCP servers file:

```
"mcpServers": {
  "mcp-server-docker": {
    "command": "uv",
    "args": [
      "--directory",
      "/path/to/repo",
      "run",
      "mcp-server-docker"
    ]
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Install with Docker</summary>

After cloning this repository, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t mcp-server-docker .
```

And then add the following to your MCP servers file:

```
"mcpServers": {
  "mcp-server-docker": {
    "command": "docker",
    "args": [
      "run",
      "-i",
      "--rm",
      "-v",
      "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock",
      "mcp-server-docker:latest"
    ]
  }
}
```

## 📝 Prompts

### 🎻 `docker_compose`

Use natural language to compose containers.

Provide a Project Name, and a description of desired containers, and let the LLM
do the rest.

This prompt instructs the LLM to enter a `plan+apply` loop. Your interaction
with the LLM will involve the following steps:

1. You give the LLM instructions for which containers to bring up
2. The LLM calculates a concise natural language plan and presents it to you
3. You either:
   - Apply the plan
   - Provide the LLM feedback, and the LLM recalculates the plan

#### Examples

- name: `nginx`, containers: "deploy an nginx container exposing it on port
  9000"
- name: `wordpress`, containers: "deploy a WordPress container and a supporting
  MySQL container, exposing Wordpress on port 9000"

#### Resuming a Project

When starting a new chat with this prompt, the LLM will receive the status of
any containers, volumes, and networks created with the given project `name`.

This is mainly useful for cleaning up, in-case you lose a chat that was
responsible for many containers.

## 📔 Resources

The server implements a couple resources for every container:

- Stats: CPU, memory, etc. for a container
- Logs: tail some logs from a container

## 🔨 Tools

### Containers

- `list_containers`
- `create_container`
- `run_container`
- `recreate_container`
- `start_container`
- `fetch_container_logs`
- `stop_container`
- `remove_container`

### Images

- `list_images`
- `pull_image`
- `push_image`
- `build_image`
- `remove_image`

### Networks

- `list_networks`
- `create_network`
- `remove_network`

### Volumes

- `list_volumes`
- `create_volume`
- `remove_volume`

### Custom Secrets

For details, see the Custom Secrets section below.

- `list_custom_secret_names`

## 🚧 Disclaimers

### Reviewing Created Containers

Be careful to review the containers that the LLM creates. Docker is not a secure
sandbox, and therefore the MCP server can potentially impact the host machine
through Docker.

For safety reasons, this MCP server doesn't support sensitive Docker options
like `--privileged` or `--cap-add/--cap-drop`. If these features are of interest
to you, file an issue on this repository with your use-case.

## 🛠️ Configuration

This server uses the Python Docker SDK's `from_env` method. For configuration
details, see
[the documentation](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/client.html#docker.client.from_env).

### 🔑 Custom Secrets

This MCP server provides a secure way to by keep sensitive configuration data
hidden from the LLM while making it accessible to containers created by the LLM.

Example configuration running in Docker:

```
"mcpServers": {
  "mcp-server-docker": {
    "command": "docker",
    "args": [
      "run",
      "-i",
      "--rm",
      "-v",
      "/home/myuser/mcp-secrets.env:/var/secrets/.env:ro",
      "-v",
      "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock",
      "mcp-server-docker:latest",
      "--docker_secrets_env_files",
      "/var/secrets/.env"
    ]
  }
}
```

Secrets are configured as key-value pairs in dotenv files, which the server
reads at runtime. The LLM uses the `list_custom_secret_names` to discover available secrets. It
then maps environment variable names to secret names for container access. When
the LLM requests container information, such as through the `list_containers`
tool, the server only reveals the environment variable names, not their values,
ensuring sensitive data remains protected.

## 💻 Development

Prefer using Devbox to configure your development environment.

See the `devbox.json` for helpful development commands.
